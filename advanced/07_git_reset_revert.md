# Git Reset and Revert

Git provides tools to undo or fix changes in your repository's history. Let's explore advanced techniques for using `git reset` and `git revert`:

## Git Reset

- `git reset` moves the branch pointer and resets the staging area, but keeps changes in your working directory.
- Use `git reset --hard` to discard changes in both the staging area and working directory.

## Git Revert

- `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes specific changes.
- Use `git revert -m` for merge commits to specify the parent commit to revert to.

## Best Practices

- Use `git reset` with caution, as it rewrites history.
- Use `git revert` when changes are already shared with others.

Advanced knowledge of `git reset` and `git revert` can help you manage mistakes and changes in a controlled manner.
