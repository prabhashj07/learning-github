# Advanced Merge Strategies

Merging branches is a fundamental part of collaboration. In advanced scenarios, you might encounter situations where standard merging is insufficient. This is where advanced merge strategies come into play:

## Squash and Rebase

- **Squash**: Combine multiple commits into one before merging. It keeps the commit history clean by eliminating trivial or intermediate commits.
- **Rebase**: Reapply commits from one branch onto another, effectively moving the base of your branch. It can lead to a linear commit history.

These strategies can help maintain a cleaner, more coherent commit history and simplify code reviews.
