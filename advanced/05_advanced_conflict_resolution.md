# Advanced Conflict Resolution

Merge conflicts can be challenging, but advanced conflict resolution techniques can help you navigate and resolve them effectively:

## Understand the Conflict

- Identify conflicting lines or sections in the conflicting file.
- Understand the changes made by both branches.

## Choose the Right Resolution

- Manually edit the conflicting file to incorporate the desired changes.
- Use `git mergetool` to resolve conflicts with external tools.

## Preserve History

- Make sure your resolution doesn't break the project's history or functionality.
- Keep in mind the project's coding standards and guidelines.

Advanced conflict resolution skills are essential for maintaining a clean and functional codebase during collaboration.
