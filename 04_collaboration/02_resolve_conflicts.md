# Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts can arise when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences between two branches. Here's how to handle them effectively:

## Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. **Identify Conflicts**: After merging or pulling changes, Git will alert you to any conflicts.

2. **Open the File**: Use a text editor to open the conflicted file. You'll notice conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) around conflicting sections.

3. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Review conflicting sections and decide which changes to keep.
   - Remove conflict markers and unwanted code.
   - Retain the desired content.

4. **Save the File**: Once conflicts are resolved, save the file.

5. **Stage the Changes**:
   - Use `git add` to stage the resolved file.
   - For multiple conflicted files, repeat this step.

6. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Use `git commit` to create a new commit with the resolved conflicts.
   - Provide a clear commit message describing the conflict resolution.

## Conflict Resolution Tips

- Test the changes after conflict resolution to ensure functionality is intact.
- Communicate with other collaborators if needed to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Effectively resolving conflicts ensures that your codebase remains functional and cohesive even during collaboration.
