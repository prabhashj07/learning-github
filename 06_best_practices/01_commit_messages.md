# Writing Clear and Informative Commit Messages

When working with version control systems like Git, writing clear and informative commit messages is a crucial skill. Well-crafted commit messages enhance collaboration, code comprehension, and project management. Here's how to write effective commit messages:

## Anatomy of a Commit Message

A commit message generally consists of a title, an optional body, and a footer:

<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>

- **Type**: Describes the purpose of the commit (e.g., feat, fix, chore).
- **Subject**: A concise summary of the change in the imperative mood.
- **Body**: Provides additional context, motivation, and details.
- **Footer**: Contains references to related issues, pull requests, or other relevant information.

## Best Practices for Commit Messages

1. **Be Descriptive**: The subject should succinctly describe what the commit does.
2. **Use the Imperative Mood**: Start the subject with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
3. **Limit Line Length**: Keep the subject line around 50 characters or less.
4. **Summarize Changes**: Highlight the main changes in the subject line.
5. **Provide Context**: Use the body to explain why the change is necessary and any side effects.
6. **Use Issue References**: Link to related issues or pull requests (e.g., "Fixes #123").
7. **Separate Concerns**: If your commit involves multiple changes, consider splitting them into separate commits.
8. **Proofread**: Commit messages reflect your professionalism, so proofread for errors.
