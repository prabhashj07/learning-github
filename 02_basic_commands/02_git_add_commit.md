# Git Add and Commit

Once you've made changes to your files, you need to add and commit them to save your progress. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your Git repository.
3. Run the following command to stage your changes for commit:

 `git add filename.ext`

Replace `filename.ext` with the actual name of the file you want to stage.

4. Run the following command to commit your changes:

 `git commit -m "Add a descriptive commit message here"`

Replace the message with a brief description of the changes you made.

Your changes are now committed to the repository's history.


- Commits cannot be deleted because each commit's hashnode is linked with previous hashcode.
