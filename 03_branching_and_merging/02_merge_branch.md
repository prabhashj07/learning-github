# Merge Branches

Merging branches brings changes from one branch into another. Here's how to merge branches:

1. Ensure you're on the branch where you want to apply the changes (often the target branch, like `main` or `master`).
2. Run the following command to merge changes from another branch:
'git merge source-branch-name'
Replace `source-branch-name` with the name of the branch you want to merge.
3. Resolve any conflicts that might occur during the merge.
4. Commit the resolved conflicts and complete the merge.

Merging is essential for combining work from different branches into a unified version of your project.
