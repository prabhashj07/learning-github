# Create a Branch

Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously. Here's how to create a new branch:

1. Ensure you're on the branch you want to base the new branch on (usually `main` or `master`).
2. Run the following command to create a new branch and switch to it:
Replace `new-branch-name` with your desired branch name.
3. Your workspace is now on the new branch. You can start making changes specific to this branch.

Remember to switch back to the original branch using `git checkout` when you're done with your work on the new branch.
'git checkout -b new-branch-name'
