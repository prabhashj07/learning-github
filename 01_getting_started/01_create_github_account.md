   - **Email Address**: Enter your email address. This will be associated with your GitHub account.

5. **Verify Your Email**: After providing your email address, GitHub will send you a verification email. Check your inbox and click the verification link to confirm your email.

6. **Complete the Setup**: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your account setup. You might be asked to provide additional information, such as a profile picture.

7. **Personalize Your Profile**: Once your account is set up, you can personalize your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and other details. This helps others identify you and learn about your contributions.

Congratulations! You now have a GitHub account and are ready to start collaborating on projects.
