# Basic Navigation in a GitHub Repository

Navigating a GitHub repository allows you to explore its contents, view code, and access important sections. Here's how to navigate a repository:

1. **Repository Overview**: When you open a repository, you'll be taken to the repository's main page. Here, you can see an overview of the repository, including its description, license, and recent activity.

2. **Tabs**: The repository's tabs provide access to different sections:
   - **Code**: This tab displays the repository's files, directories, and code.
   - **Issues**: Here, you can view and create issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and enhancements.
   - **Pull Requests**: This tab shows open and closed pull requests for the repository.
   - **Actions**: If GitHub Actions workflows are set up, you can view their status and details here.
   - **Projects**: If projects are set up, you can manage and track project tasks.
   - **Wiki**: If a wiki is available, it contains documentation and additional information.
   - **Security**: This tab provides insights into the security of your repository.

3. **Code Navigation**:
   - Use the file explorer to browse through files and directories in the "Code" tab.
   - Click on a file to view its content and history.
   - Use the breadcrumb navigation to move back through directories.

4. **Branches and Tags**:
   - Click on the branch/tag dropdown to switch between branches or view tags.
   - The default branch (often "main" or "master") shows the most up-to-date code.

5. **README**: If a repository has a README file, it's displayed on the main page. This is often used to provide an introduction and basic instructions.

6. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific files, code, issues, and more within the repository.

7. **View Commits**: In the "Code" tab, you can view the commit history to see changes made over time.

8. **File History**: When viewing a file, you can access its history to see previous versions, changes, and contributors.

Navigation is a crucial skill for effective collaboration on GitHub. Familiarize yourself with these basics to explore repositories and contribute effectively.
