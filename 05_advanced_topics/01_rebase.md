# Git Rebase

Git rebase is a powerful command that allows you to modify the commit history and integrate changes from one branch into another in a more linear manner. This can help keep your commit history organized and easier to follow.

## Performing Git Rebase

1. **Switch to Target Branch**: Make sure you're on the branch you want to apply changes to, often the target branch.

2. **Fetch Remote Changes**: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date commits.

3. **Start Rebase**: Run the following command:

   'git rebase origin/source-branch'

Replace `origin/source-branch` with the source branch containing the changes you want to integrate.

4. **Resolve Conflicts**: If there are conflicts, Git will pause the rebase and ask you to resolve them for each commit. Resolve conflicts, stage changes, and continue the rebase.

5. **Continue Rebase**: After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase with:

   'git rebase --continue'


6. **Abort Rebase**: If you decide to cancel the rebase due to issues, you can use:

   'git rebase --abort'

This returns your branch to the state it was in before the rebase started.

7. **Finish Rebase**: Once the rebase is complete, your changes from the source branch are integrated into the target branch.

## Rebase vs. Merge

- Rebase results in a linear commit history, which can make it easier to track changes over time.
- Merge preserves the commit history of both branches, creating a merge commit.

## When to Use Rebase

- Use rebase to integrate changes from the main branch into your feature branch, maintaining a cleaner history.
- Rebase can be helpful when you want to squash or reorder commits before merging.

## Caution

- Only rebase commits that haven't been pushed to a public repository.
- Avoid rebasing shared branches to prevent confusion among collaborators.

By mastering `git rebase`, you can maintain a cleaner commit history and streamline your development process.
